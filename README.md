# IcePlanets

This is a planet generation experiment in unity.

Currently it only generates a cubesphere based on the tutorials from [catlikecoding](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/cube-sphere/) and some random noise using [FastNoise_CSharp](https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise_CSharp)

There is some basic LOD, but it doesn't work very well and it generates everything at runtime which causes lag spikes.

The shapeGenerator/ColorGenerator are mostly inspired from [sebastian lague series on procedural planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN39W020LqU).
